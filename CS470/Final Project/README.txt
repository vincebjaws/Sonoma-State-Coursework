This code uses the .mlx files DoAll and DoAllSmall to run. DoAll takes a long time as it runs the entire program 16 times, once per subject with and without sliding window. DoAllSmall only runs once, so use that if you're short on time. Simply run the script and it will complete everything, showing the results in the output window: tuned hyperparameter plane, ROC curve, graphs of each test run, accuracy and F1Score (a 1X8 vector for DoAll, one number for DoAllSmall), and for DoAll, mean and std for both accuracy and F1Score.
Use ClearAll to remove any leftover data from previous runs, this is mostly to save space or make the program easier to package.
